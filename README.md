# Up Next

This addon shows a popup window notification automatically to prompt for playing the next unwatched episode.

The default settings should be enough for most, but changes can be made in the addon settings (*the addon is in the services section of kodi addons*)

##### Addon Settings:

  * simple/fancy mode - by default the windows are in fancy mode, but a simpler version can be selected to be shown in the settings.
  * The notification time can be adjusted (default 30 seconds before the end)
  * The default action (ie Play/Do not Play) when nothing is pressed can also be configured
  * The number of episodes played in a row with no intervention to bring up the still watching window can be adjusted.

For [Addon Integration](https://github.com/im85288/service.upnext/wiki/Addon-Integration) and [Skinners](https://github.com/im85288/service.upnext/wiki/Skinners) see the [wiki](https://github.com/im85288/service.upnext/wiki)
